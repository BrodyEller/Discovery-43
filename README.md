You are one of 7 people stranded on an Antarctica Research Base. The scientists recently found an alien frozen in the ice and excavated it to store at their base. The “Imitator,” the name they gave the alien, thaws out and escapes into the base. The men at the base realize the Imitator has escaped and start to panic. The Imitator has had enough time to change into anybody. Since Comms have been down because of a blizzard, they have no immediate way out. They find one of the alien imitations and burn it outside, but they still believe that some of them aren’t who they seem.
